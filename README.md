SmartStressDetection is a beginner-friendly but powerful web application that helps users understand and manage their stress using machine learning and user-friendly design. 
This system is built using **Django**, **Python**, **HTML/CSS** & **Machine Learning** to provide a seamless and insightful experience. It is especially helpful for **students**, **office workers**, and **young adults** who want to manage their mental well-being more effectively.

## Features

-  **User Signup & Login** – Secure authentication system
-  **Image Upload** – Upload image to detect stress
- **Stress Prediction** – ML model analyzes and predicts stress level
- **Face Heatmap** – Shows stress region heatmap on face
- **Weekly Stress Graph** – Track stress over time
- **Prediction History** – See past predictions and progress
- **Personalized Tips** – Get suggestions to reduce stress
- **Low Confidence Alert** – Alerts if model is uncertain (<50%)
- **Secure backend with Django authentication

 ## Technology Used 

  | Area           | Technology                    
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Backend        | Django (Python)               |
| Frontend       | HTML, CSS, JavaScript         |
| ML Integration | Pickle Model (.pkl)           |
| ML Algorithm   | Random Forest Classifier      |
| Database       | SQLite                        |

## How It Works

1. **Create an Account** or **Login**
2. Upload your **face image**
3. The model predicts your **stress level**
4. View **heatmap**, **stress tips** and **weekly graph**
5. Your predictions are stored for **future reference**

## Motivation
It’s not just about technology. It’s about helping people feel better every day.


## Future Improvements
1. Real-time camera feed integration
2. Mobile responsive dashboard
3. Email-based notifications for reports
4. Integration with wearable device APIs
